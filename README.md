# GraphQL-async

Asyncio GraphQL for Python.

*This repository is an attempt to integrate the code from [graphql-core](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core), 
[graphql-ws](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws),
and [aiohttp-graphql](https://github.com/graphql-python/aiohttp-graphql)
relying only on asyncio.
In particular, this repo uses [aioreactive](https://github.com/dbrattli/aioreactive) instead of RxPY.
